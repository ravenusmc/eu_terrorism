  This is a project that will show the deaths, from terrorism in Europe from 1970 to 2014. I have a background in International Relations and I am very interested in looking at data and what it can tell us about the world around us. The data all comes form the fivethirtyeight github repo at: https://github.com/fivethirtyeight/data/blob/master/terrorism/eu_terrorism_fatalities_by_country.csv

  To use this program, you will need Pandas, numpy and matplotlib installed.
